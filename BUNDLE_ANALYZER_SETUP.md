# Next.js Bundle Analyzer Setup and Configuration

## Overview
Successfully configured Next.js bundle analyzer and optimization features for the LinearTime Calendar Integration Platform.

## Installation
```bash
pnpm add -D @next/bundle-analyzer
```

## Configuration

### next.config.ts
- **Bundle Analyzer**: Configured with ANALYZE environment variable
- **Webpack Memory Optimizations**: Enabled for better build performance
- **Package Import Optimizations**: Added for key UI libraries

Key optimizations configured:
```typescript
experimental: {
  webpackMemoryOptimizations: true,
  optimizePackageImports: [
    '@radix-ui/react-accordion',
    '@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog',
    '@radix-ui/react-dialog',
    '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu',
    '@radix-ui/react-popover',
    '@radix-ui/react-select',
    '@radix-ui/react-tabs',
    '@radix-ui/react-toast',
    '@radix-ui/react-tooltip',
    '@tabler/icons-react',
    'framer-motion',
    'react-dnd',
    'tui-calendar',
    'tui-time-picker',
    'react-syntax-highlighter',
    'react-window'
  ],
}
```

### package.json Scripts
- `build:analyze`: Run bundle analysis with Webpack (standard build)
- `build:analyze-turbo`: Run bundle analysis with Turbopack (when working)

## Baseline Measurements

### Bundle Analysis Reports Generated
- **Node.js bundle report**: `/Users/goodfranklin/lineartime/.next/analyze/nodejs.html` (2.7MB)
- **Edge runtime report**: `/Users/goodfranklin/lineartime/.next/analyze/edge.html` (461KB)

### Bundle Status
- Bundle analyzer successfully configured and functional
- Reports generated before build failure due to missing components
- Configuration optimized for the project's dependency stack

## Usage

### Run Bundle Analysis
```bash
# Standard webpack build with analysis
pnpm run build:analyze

# Turbopack build with analysis (when build issues are resolved)
pnpm run build:analyze-turbo
```

### View Results
Bundle analyzer automatically opens reports in browser, or manually open:
- Node.js bundle: `.next/analyze/nodejs.html`
- Edge bundle: `.next/analyze/edge.html`

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Build Errors**: Resolve missing component imports to get complete bundle analysis
   - Fix missing `HybridCalendar` component references in test pages
   - Fix syntax errors in `EnhancedAuthLayout.tsx`
   - Resolve missing `VirtualCalendar` component

2. **Optimization Opportunities**: Once build succeeds, analyze reports for:
   - Large dependencies that can be optimized
   - Unused code that can be removed
   - Opportunities for code splitting
   - Package import optimizations

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Establish baseline metrics and track improvements:
   - Bundle size trends
   - Loading performance
   - Memory usage during builds

## Configuration Benefits

### Memory Optimizations
- `webpackMemoryOptimizations: true` reduces memory usage during compilation
- Helps with large codebases and CI/CD environments

### Package Import Optimizations
- Automatically optimizes imports from configured libraries
- Reduces bundle size by tree-shaking unused modules
- Libraries like `lucide-react`, `date-fns`, `recharts` are optimized by default

### Bundle Analysis Integration
- Environment variable based activation (`ANALYZE=true`)
- Conditional loading to avoid issues in production
- Separate scripts for different build configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Bundle analyzer runs before compilation, so reports may be generated even if build fails
2. **Turbopack Compatibility**: Some features may not work with Turbopack yet
3. **Memory Usage**: Large projects may require additional memory configuration

### Resolution
- Use standard webpack build for analysis until Turbopack issues are resolved
- Fix import errors and missing components for complete analysis
- Monitor bundle sizes and optimize based on generated reports
