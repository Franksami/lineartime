## 📖 Epic User Stories

## Epic 1: Multi-Provider Calendar Unification

### Story 1.1: Initial Provider Connection
```gherkin
Feature: Connect Multiple Calendar Providers
  As a user with calendars across multiple providers
  I want to securely connect all my calendar accounts
  So that I have one unified view of my schedule

Background:
  Given I am a new LinearTime user
  And I have calendars in Google, Microsoft, and Apple
  
Scenario: Connect Google Calendar
  Given I am on the provider connection page
  When I click "Connect Google Calendar"
  And I complete OAuth authentication successfully
  Then I should see my Google events in the unified timeline
  And real-time sync should be established
  And I should receive a confirmation notification
  
  Examples:
    | Provider | Auth Method | Expected Sync Time |
    | Google   | OAuth 2.0   | < 30 seconds       |
    | Microsoft| OAuth 2.0   | < 30 seconds       |
    | Apple    | CalDAV      | < 60 seconds       |

Scenario: Handle Authentication Failure
  Given I am connecting a Google Calendar
  When OAuth authentication fails
  Then I should see a clear error message
  And I should be offered troubleshooting steps
  And I should be able to retry the connection
  
Scenario: Multiple Provider Connection
  Given I have successfully connected Google Calendar
  When I connect Microsoft Calendar
  Then both calendars should appear in unified view
  And events from both providers should be synchronized
  And no duplicate events should be created
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ OAuth 2.0 authentication for Google and Microsoft
- ✅ CalDAV authentication for Apple and generic providers  
- ✅ Connection status indicators and error handling
- ✅ Automatic token refresh and re-authentication

  When I edit the event in LinearTime
  Then the changes should sync back to Google Calendar
  And I should see real-time update confirmation
  And the event should maintain its provider association

Scenario: Delete Event with Confirmation
  Given I have an event from Microsoft Calendar
  When I delete the event in LinearTime
  Then I should see a confirmation dialog
  When I confirm the deletion
  Then the event should be deleted from Microsoft Calendar
  And removed from the unified view
  And I should receive deletion confirmation
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
