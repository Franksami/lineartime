# Motion — Scheduling Automation & Conflict Repair

## Summary
- **AI-Powered Constraint Solving**: Modern scheduling uses constraint-based optimization with hard/soft constraints for conflict resolution
- **Real-Time Conflict Detection**: Systems detect conflicts via unique pair analysis (same timeslot, same resource) with penalty scoring
- **Apply/Undo Patterns**: Workflow automation supports preview, apply, and rollback operations for user trust
- **Constraint Visualization**: Conflicts are justified with detailed explanations (teacher conflict, room conflict, etc.)
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-threaded solving with termination conditions and incremental updates
- **Automation Orchestration**: Event-driven workflows with conditional logic and parallel execution

## Design Implications
- **Constraint-Based Architecture**: Implement hard constraints (conflicts) and soft constraints (preferences) with penalty scoring
- **Real-Time Conflict Detection**: Use forEachUniquePair patterns to detect timeslot/resource conflicts efficiently
- **Justification System**: Provide detailed conflict explanations (RoomConflictJustification, TeacherConflictJustification)
- **Apply/Undo Workflow**: Preview mode with simulation, apply with logging, rollback capability
- **Performance Optimization**: Multi-threaded solving with termination conditions and incremental updates
- **Agent Orchestration**: Event-driven workflow automation with conditional branching and parallel execution

## Acceptance Criteria Updates
- **Conflict Detection Performance**: Real-time conflict detection using constraint-based analysis ≤500ms
- **Constraint Justification**: Detailed conflict explanations with affected entities and impact assessment
- **Apply/Undo Logging**: Complete audit trail for all scheduling changes with rollback capability
- **Simulation Preview**: Visual diff showing proposed changes before application
- **Multi-threaded Solving**: Performance optimization with AUTO thread configuration for large datasets
- **Agent Response Time**: Scheduling suggestions and conflict repairs ≤2s with justification
