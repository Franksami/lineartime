# Computer Vision â€” Privacy & Consent Patterns

## Summary
- **Local-Only Processing**: Computer vision operations performed entirely on user's machine without sending data to external servers
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: All image recognition, OCR, and object detection executed locally with no external API calls
- **Consent & Transparency**: Explicit user consent required with clear documentation of what data is processed
- **Auto-Approval Patterns**: Pre-approved operations list for trusted CV functions (crop, resize, blur, etc.)
- **Model Management**: Local model storage with automatic downloads and version management
- **Tool Validation**: Robust validation middleware with user-friendly error messages and security checks
- **Audit Logging**: Complete operation logging with input/output paths and processing results

## Design Implications
- **Local Model Architecture**: Download and manage computer vision models locally with automatic setup and validation
- **Privacy-First Processing**: All CV operations execute locally with no external API calls or data transmission
- **Auto-Approval System**: Pre-approved operation lists for trusted CV functions with user-configurable security levels
- **Transparent Operation Logging**: Complete audit trail of CV operations with input/output paths and processing metadata
- **Validation Middleware**: Robust parameter validation with user-friendly error messages and security checks
- **Model Isolation**: Separate model management system with automated downloads and version control
- **Consent Documentation**: Clear user consent flows with explicit documentation of data processing scope

## Acceptance Criteria Updates
- **100% Local Processing**: All computer vision operations must execute locally without external API calls
- **Explicit Consent System**: User consent required before any CV processing with clear scope documentation
- **Auto-Approval Configuration**: User-configurable lists of trusted CV operations with granular permission control
- **Complete Operation Logging**: Full audit trail for all CV operations with input/output paths and processing results
- **Model Security**: Local model management with validation, version control, and automatic integrity checks
- **Privacy Indicators**: Clear visual indicators when CV processing is active with scope and duration information
- **Error Transparency**: User-friendly validation error messages with clear remediation guidance
