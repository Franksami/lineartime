# AI in Workspaces — Contextual Surfaces & Omnibox

## Summary
- **Contextual Conversation Management**: AI assistants use slot-based state management with conversation flow control
- **Intent Classification & Routing**: Natural language input parsed into intents with confidence thresholds and entity extraction
- **Multi-Turn Context Awareness**: AI systems maintain conversation history (max_history) for contextual decision making
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time AI responses with progressive disclosure and user feedback loops
- **Featurized State Management**: Slots influence conversation flow with type-aware state (boolean, categorical, custom)
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Structured data querying with mention resolution and attribute retrieval
- **Story-Based Training**: Conversation flows defined as reusable story patterns with checkpoints and OR statements
