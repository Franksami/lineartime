# Sunsama â€” Ritual Planning Patterns

## Summary
- **Recurring Workflow Automation**: Schedule-based execution of rituals with automatic triggering and progress tracking
- **Step-Based Progression**: Workflows broken into steps with completion states (complete/incomplete/skip/assign)
- **Data Collection & Reflection**: Each step can collect data, comments, and signatures for documentation
- **Role-Based Assignments**: Steps assigned to specific users or roles with automatic routing
- **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic workflow paths based on collected data and completion states
- **API-Driven Integration**: Real-time workflow state management with webhooks for external system integration
- **Template & Import System**: Easy workflow creation from existing documents, spreadsheets, or templates

## Design Implications
- **Recurring Workflow Engine**: Implement schedule-based workflow automation with automatic run creation
- **Step State Management**: Complete/uncomplete/skip/assign patterns with progress tracking
- **Data Collection Integration**: Each workflow step can collect structured data, comments, and signatures
- **Role-Based Routing**: Automatic assignment of workflow steps to appropriate users or roles
- **Conditional Workflow Logic**: Dynamic paths based on step completion data and user responses
- **API & Webhook Integration**: Real-time workflow state synchronization with external systems
- **Template System**: Import workflows from documents/spreadsheets with guided setup flows

## Acceptance Criteria Updates
- **Workflow Scheduling**: Automatic recurring workflow execution with configurable timing and triggers
- **Step State API**: Complete REST API for step management (complete/uncomplete/skip/assign/comment)
- **Data Collection**: Structured data capture within workflow steps with validation and persistence
- **Role Assignment**: Automatic user/role routing for workflow steps with notification systems
- **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic workflow branching based on step completion data and user input
- **Template Import**: Easy workflow creation from existing documents with guided import process
- **Integration Webhooks**: Real-time workflow event notifications for external system synchronization
