# üîß TASKMASTER CLEANUP & REORGANIZATION STRATEGY

**Date**: August 23, 2025  
**Foundation Status**: üîí LOCKED - Must reflect in all tasks  
**Current Status**: 47 tasks, 21% realistic completion  
**Cleanup Goal**: Accurate task organization reflecting foundation reality

---

## üéØ **TASKMASTER CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS**

### **‚úÖ CORRECTLY COMPLETED TASKS (Keep Status)**
- **Task #13**: Setup Core Project Infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **Task #14**: Implement Core Data Structures ‚úÖ 
- **Task #15**: Develop Year Grid Renderer ‚úÖ (Our foundation achievement)
- **Task #16**: Build Event Rendering ‚úÖ
- **Task #17**: Implement Event Management ‚úÖ

### **‚ö†Ô∏è TASKS WITH OUTDATED DESCRIPTIONS (Need Updates)**
- **Task #1**: Mentions "Vite/React" (we use Next.js 15)
- **Task #1**: References "Geist design system" (we use Vercel theme)  
- **Task #1**: Mentions "Jest/React Testing Library" (we use Playwright)
- **Task #2**: May reference vertical calendar (check description)
- **Task #3**: Month/day development (verify alignment with foundation)

### **‚ùå TASKS THAT MAY CONFLICT WITH FOUNDATION (Review Required)**
- Tasks referencing vertical layouts
- Tasks mentioning MobileCalendarView usage
- Tasks assuming LocalStorage (we use IndexedDB)
- Tasks with component names that don't match current implementation

### **üîÑ TASKS NEEDING VERIFICATION (Test Before Marking Complete)**
- **Task #4**: Event Data Model (IndexedDB vs described implementation)
- **Task #5**: Drag and Drop (verify actually working with foundation)
- **Tasks #6-12**: Event features (verify integration with foundation)

---

## üìã **CLEANUP EXECUTION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Task Description Updates (High Priority)**

#### **Update Outdated Technology References**
```bash
# Tasks mentioning wrong tech stack:
task-master update-task --id=1 --prompt="Update to reflect Next.js 15, Vercel theme, Playwright testing, and current foundation achievement"

# Tasks mentioning deprecated components:
task-master update-task --id=2 --prompt="Update to reflect LinearCalendarHorizontal as primary component, remove vertical layout references"

# Tasks with wrong storage references:
task-master update-task --id=4 --prompt="Update to reflect IndexedDB implementation with Dexie, remove LocalStorage references"
```

#### **Foundation Compliance Updates**
```bash
# Update task descriptions to reference locked foundation:
task-master update --from=6 --prompt="Update all task descriptions to ensure compatibility with locked LinearCalendarHorizontal foundation. Remove any references to vertical layouts, MobileCalendarView, or component architectures that conflict with our 12-month horizontal row structure."
```

### **Phase 2: Task Status Reality Check (High Priority)**

#### **Verify "Done" Tasks Are Actually Complete**
```typescript
// Manual verification needed for these claimed "done" tasks:

Task #4: Event Data Model
- CHECK: Is IndexedDB integration actually working?
- CHECK: Are events persisting and loading correctly?
- CHECK: Is the useOfflineEvents hook functional?

Task #5: Drag and Drop System  
- CHECK: Can users actually drag events in the foundation?
- CHECK: Is @dnd-kit properly integrated?
- CHECK: Do events move correctly on the grid?

Task #16: Event Rendering
- CHECK: Do events actually render on the foundation grid?
- CHECK: Are event categories and colors working?
- CHECK: Is event stacking algorithm functional?

Task #17: Event Management
- CHECK: Is event CRUD actually working?
- CHECK: Are event modals functional?
- CHECK: Is the FloatingToolbar working?
```

#### **Task Status Corrections**
```bash
# If verification reveals issues, update status:
task-master set-status --id=X --status=pending  # If feature doesn't actually work
task-master set-status --id=X --status=in-progress  # If partially working

# If verification confirms working:
# Keep status as done and add verification notes:
task-master update-subtask --id=X.1 --prompt="Verified working with foundation on [date]. Integration confirmed functional."
```

### **Phase 3: New Foundation-Specific Tasks (Medium Priority)**

#### **Add Missing Foundation Protection Tasks**
```bash
# Add tasks that reflect our current reality:
task-master add-task --prompt="Create foundation validation tests to ensure 12-month horizontal structure is never violated" --research

task-master add-task --prompt="Implement mobile foundation optimization to replace MobileCalendarView with responsive LinearCalendarHorizontal" --research

task-master add-task --prompt="Create comprehensive documentation update to remove all references to vertical layouts and deprecated components" --research
```

#### **Integration Tasks for Existing Features**
```bash
# Add integration tasks for built-but-unconnected features:
task-master add-task --prompt="Integrate Canvas rendering system with LinearCalendarHorizontal for large event datasets (10K+ events)" --research

task-master add-task --prompt="Connect AI Assistant features with LinearCalendarHorizontal foundation for scheduling suggestions" --research

task-master add-task --prompt="Integrate CommandBar natural language processing with foundation event creation" --research
```

### **Phase 4: Dependency Cleanup (Medium Priority)**

#### **Fix Task Dependencies**
```bash
# Review and fix dependency chains:
# Remove dependencies on non-existent or deprecated tasks
# Add dependencies on foundation protection
# Ensure logical dependency flow

# Example fixes:
task-master add-dependency --id=28 --depends-on=15  # Mobile fix depends on foundation
task-master add-dependency --id=30 --depends-on=28  # Event integration depends on mobile fix
```

### **Phase 5: Task Organization (Low Priority)**

#### **Task Categorization**
```yaml
foundation_tasks:
  - Foundation structure (completed ‚úÖ)
  - Foundation protection (ongoing)
  - Mobile foundation compliance (critical)

integration_tasks:
  - Event system integration
  - AI feature integration  
  - Performance system integration
  - Testing system integration

feature_tasks:
  - Canvas rendering activation
  - Virtual scrolling implementation
  - External API integrations
  - Collaboration features

cleanup_tasks:
  - Documentation updates
  - Deprecated component removal
  - Configuration cleanup
```

## üß™ **TASKMASTER VALIDATION WORKFLOW**

### **After Each TaskMaster Update:**
```bash
# 1. Validate Task Dependencies
task-master validate-dependencies

# 2. Check Task Logic
task-master list  # Review updated task list
task-master next  # Verify next task makes sense

# 3. Test Task Descriptions
# Read task descriptions to ensure they align with foundation

# 4. Verify Completion Status
# Ensure marked "done" tasks are actually working
```

### **Quality Checks**
```bash
# Task Description Quality
- ‚úÖ Mentions correct components (LinearCalendarHorizontal)
- ‚úÖ References current tech stack (Next.js, IndexedDB, Playwright)
- ‚úÖ Aligns with foundation lock requirements
- ‚úÖ No conflicts with "Life is bigger than a week" philosophy

# Task Status Accuracy  
- ‚úÖ "Done" tasks are actually functional
- ‚úÖ "Pending" tasks have accurate requirements
- ‚úÖ Dependencies reflect real relationships
- ‚úÖ Priorities match current project goals
```
