# Linear Calendar - Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the technical implementation for transforming a basic linear calendar into an enterprise-grade, AI-powered scheduling platform. The implementation targets 60fps performance with 10,000+ events, natural language processing, real-time collaboration, and intelligent scheduling capabilities comparable to Fantastical, Reclaim.ai, and Notion Calendar.

**Target Metrics:**

- Infer event categories from keywords

### 2.2 Command Bar Implementation

- Global keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
- Real-time parsing feedback
- Preview parsed events
- Confidence scoring
- Auto-scroll to target date

## Phase 3: AI-Powered Scheduling (Weeks 7-9)

### 3.1 Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Solver

- Implement hard constraints (no double-booking, working hours)
- Add soft constraints (energy levels, context switching)
- Score time slots based on constraints
- Generate top 5 optimal slots
- Implement backtracking search with forward checking

### 3.2 Focus Time Protection

- Create focus blocks (deep-work, shallow-work, break)
- Negotiate with conflicting events
- Auto-decline low-priority meetings
- Lock focus blocks in calendar
- Calculate importance scores

## Phase 4: Real-Time Collaboration (Weeks 10-12)

### 4.1 WebSocket & CRDT Implementation

- Initialize Yjs document for conflict-free updates
- Set up WebSocket provider for real-time sync
- Implement IndexedDB persistence for offline support
- Create Y.Map for events, Y.Array for ordering
- Handle conflict resolution with three-way merge

### 4.2 Offline-First with Service Worker

- Precache static assets

- Handle offline fallback
- Sync pending events when online

## Phase 5: Storage Migration & Data Architecture

### 5.1 IndexedDB Implementation

- Create Dexie database schema
- Implement compound indexes for range queries
- Migrate from LocalStorage with rollback capability
- Add bulk sync operations
- Version management for schema updates

## Phase 6: Mobile Optimization

### 6.1 Touch Gesture Handler

## Phase 10: Performance Monitoring

### 10.1 Performance Metrics Collection

- Track Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Monitor event render times
- Track scroll performance and frame drops
- Monitor memory usage
- Implement high memory usage handling

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| Initial Load Time | <500ms | Performance.timing |
| Time to Interactive | <1s | Lighthouse |
| Event Render Time | <3ms/event | Custom metrics |
| Scroll FPS | 60fps | requestAnimationFrame |
| Memory Usage | <100MB typical | performance.memory |
| Sync Latency | <100ms | Network timing |
| Conflict Resolution | <50ms | CRDT benchmarks |
| NLP Parse Time | <100ms | Custom timing |
| Mobile Touch Delay | <50ms | Event timestamps |

## Technical Decisions

- Yjs over Automerge for CRDT (30% smaller payload)
- IndexedDB over LocalStorage (async, unlimited storage)
- Canvas for >5 overlapping events (DOM for interactivity)
- Pointer Events over Touch Events (unified input handling)
- Web Components for plugins (true isolation)
- Service Workers for offline (background sync capability)

## Migration Strategy

- Always implement rollback capability
- Backup current state before migration
- Verify migration success
- Keep backup for 30 days
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout

## Implementation Priority

1. **Week 1-2**: Performance Foundation (CRITICAL - app breaks without this)
2. **Week 3-4**: Storage Migration
3. **Week 5-6**: NLP & Command Bar
4. **Week 7-8**: AI Scheduling
5. **Week 9-10**: Collaboration
6. **Week 11-12**: Mobile & Accessibility

## Critical Implementation Notes

- Performance First: Always implement virtual scrolling before adding features
- Progressive Enhancement: Each feature should work independently
- Backward Compatibility: Maintain LocalStorage read capability during migration
- Feature Flags: Use environment variables to enable/disable features
- Testing: Implement performance tests before features
