# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Base Time Scale Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a foundational time scale component that can handle different zoom levels and time unit representations
### Details:
Create a TimeScale class that manages time unit calculations, formatting, and scale transformations. Implement methods for converting between pixel coordinates and time values. Setup basic rendering structure with SVG or Canvas.

## 2. Develop Year and Quarter Views [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement year and quarter level visualizations with appropriate markers and labels
### Details:
Create year and quarter view components using the base time scale. Implement appropriate tick marks, labels, and grid lines. Add year/quarter boundaries and proper date formatting. Ensure proper handling of leap years.

## 3. Implement Month and Week Views [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Create month and week level visualizations with detailed time representations
### Details:
Develop month and week view components with appropriate granularity. Add week numbers, month names, and day markers. Implement proper handling of month transitions and week boundaries.

## 4. Create Day View with Hours [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement detailed day view with hour-level granularity
### Details:
Build day view component with hour markers and minute indicators. Add support for different time zones and daylight saving time transitions. Implement proper time formatting and grid system.

## 5. Implement Zoom Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Add smooth transitions between different time scale views
### Details:
Create animation system for transitioning between zoom levels. Implement interpolation for scale changes. Add gesture support for zoom interactions. Ensure smooth rendering during transitions. Handle state preservation during zoom operations.
