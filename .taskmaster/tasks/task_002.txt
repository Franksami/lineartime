# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Glass Morphism Design System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create reusable glass morphism components and utilities following Apple's Liquid Glass design language
# Details:
1. Implement glass effect utilities in Tailwind
2. Create base glass components (GlassCard, GlassButton, GlassDialog)
3. Setup OKLCH color system
4. Implement liquid animations
5. Add blur and transparency effects
6. Create glass morphism hooks for interactive effects

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual regression testing
2. Performance testing for animations
3. Cross-browser compatibility tests
4. Accessibility contrast testing
5. Component interaction tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup OKLCH Color System and Glass Effect Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the OKLCH color system and create Tailwind utilities for glass morphism effects
### Details:
Configure Tailwind config to support OKLCH colors, create custom utilities for backdrop-filter, blur effects, and transparency. Define color palette variables following Apple's Liquid Glass design guidelines

## 2. Create Base Glass Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop core glass morphism components including GlassCard, GlassButton, and GlassDialog
### Details:
Implement React components using the glass effect utilities. Include proper transparency layers, blur effects, and border treatments. Ensure components are responsive and maintain consistent glass effect across different backgrounds

## 3. Implement Liquid Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create smooth, fluid animations for glass component interactions
### Details:
Use Framer Motion or React Spring to implement liquid-like animations for hover states, focus states, and transitions. Include subtle transform effects and smooth blur adjustments

## 4. Develop Interactive Glass Morphism Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create custom React hooks for handling glass morphism interactive effects
### Details:
Implement hooks for managing hover states, focus states, and interaction effects. Include cursor tracking for dynamic lighting effects and parallax movements

## 5. Implement Advanced Blur and Transparency System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.4
### Description: Create an advanced system for managing blur and transparency effects based on component state and context
### Details:
Develop a context-aware system that adjusts blur and transparency based on component stacking, background content, and user interaction. Include performance optimizations for blur effects
