# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base TimelineMinimap Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the foundational TimelineMinimap React component with basic structure and styling
### Details:
Create a new React component TimelineMinimap.tsx with a fixed-height container, basic styling, and props interface for timeline data. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout. Include prop types for timeline range, events, and viewport position.

## 2. Implement Viewport Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Add visual representation of current viewport position and size within the minimap
### Details:
Create a translucent overlay component that represents the current viewport. Calculate and update position based on main timeline scroll position. Implement viewport scaling based on zoom level. Use transform: translate for smooth positioning.

## 3. Add Event Density Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create visual representation of event distribution across the timeline
### Details:
Implement algorithm to calculate event density per time unit. Create canvas-based visualization using requestAnimationFrame for performance. Use color intensity or bar height to represent density. Include caching mechanism for density calculations.

## 4. Implement Click Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Enable quick navigation by clicking different areas of the minimap
### Details:
Add click event handlers to the minimap. Calculate target timeline position based on click coordinates. Implement smooth scrolling animation using requestAnimationFrame. Add debounce for performance optimization.

## 5. Add Drag Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Implement drag functionality for viewport manipulation
### Details:
Add mouse/touch event listeners for drag operations. Implement drag start, move, and end handlers. Calculate viewport position during drag. Use pointer events for cross-device compatibility. Add momentum scrolling for mobile.
